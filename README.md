# Neuroscience and slice ephys tools

This repository contains .stl files for 3D printing tools for slicing electrophysiology.

## Slice incubation chamber
The slice incubation chamber is a heavily modified version of a chamber created by Yianni Migias: https://www.printables.com/model/874248-ephys-brain-slice-tissue-holder. The modifications include:
- Shorter to reduce the amount of ACSF needed.
- Removable chimney to allow for easy cleaning.
- Grate inside the chimney to allow use of a Ace Glass gas diffuser like the 9435-09 filter sticks. I suggest getting one that has short stem if you do not get 9435-09.
- Removable well insert insert to allow for changing the nylon stocking support.
- Dedicated holder for the chamber so that you do not need to purchase a specific beaker type.

## Slice honeycomb chamber
The slice incubation chamber is a heavily modified version of a chamber I can no longer find since it was hosted on Shapeways which went out of business but was originally located here: https://www.shapeways.com/product/NU8RL84WC/slice-incubation-chamber. The modifications include:
- Grate inside the chimney to allow use of a Ace Glass gas diffuser like the 9435-09 filter sticks. I suggest getting one that has short stem if you do not get 9435-09.
- Dedicated holder for the chamber so that you do not need to purchase a specific beaker type.

## Slice recording chamber
The slice recording chamber is a replacement for the Warner PH1 and has a large round chamber like Scientifica recording chambers.
- For printing the slice recording chamber I suggest using 6 wall loops (or the equivalent on your printer) since the print seems to come out better.
- Use 0.2 mm wall height.
- Sparsity infill density of 25%

## Stim probe holder
The stim probe holder is used to hold a stimulating electrode on a manipulator that has a dovetail mount. This will fit in Scientifica and Luigs and Neumman manipulators. You will need M2 heat set inserts and ~15mm M2 screws.

## Sipper holder
The sipper holder is for using larger sippers on Med Associates hardware. You will need 6-32 nylon screws and 6-32 heat set inserts (1/8" long).
